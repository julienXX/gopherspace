Finger your own adventure
=========================

Last night I had a funny idea, what if I could play a Choose Your Own
Adventure game via finger?

After some searches I was able to find a plain-text version of a CYOA
book. I just had to define how the game would be playable. I though of
splitting the book in files, one per page and use a regular expression
to route the finger query to the correct page.

The finger server on my server is efingerd[0], when editing its list
file I noticed the #!/bin/sh shebang. I know the bash shell supports
regular expressions so in my '/etc/efingerd/nouser' file I changed the
shebang to #!/bin/bash and added:

      if [[ "$3" =~ ^[0-9]{1,3}$ ]]; then
        if [ -e /var/finger/cyoa/$3 ]; then
          cat /var/finger/cyoa/$3
          exit 0
        fi
      fi

I match $3 (the user/service name you try to finger) againt a 1 to 3
digits regular expression and then check if a file with that name
exists. And that's it! I have some nice "dynamic" routing to the
proper book page.

You can try it here[1].

Hope you like it!
