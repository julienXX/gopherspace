Announcing Soccer on Gopher
===========================

Following Gophsters I made a score table generator for gopher.  You
can view it here [0]. Source code is available on GitHub [1].  It's
written in Rust and uses some scripts to copute the files then upload
them on SDF.

Hope you'll like it :)
