Phlogging
=========


It's 2018 and the many attacks on the web and what it has become have
made me reconsider alternatives. I love plain-text and simplicity so
Gopher seems like the way of the future for free content without ads,
marketing, mining JavaScript code...

So here's a dump of my blog articles and I hope I'll phlog more than I
blog.

Long live plain-text, long live Gopher!
