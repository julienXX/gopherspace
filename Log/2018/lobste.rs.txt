Lobste.rs
=========

Following my toot[0] I decided to try to build a Lobsters[1] mirror on
Gopher.  So here is a first attempt that you can view here[2].  It's
written in Rust and the source code is available on Github[3].
Currently it just dumps the latest stories as a gophermap. Next I'll
add some auto-update.
Any suggestion is more than welcome!
