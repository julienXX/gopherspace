Gophsters
=========

It's alive! Finally Gophsters, my Lobsters[0] mirror on Gopher, is
online [1].  I still have to improve the code which is pretty rough at
the moment (no unit tests...) but I'm quite satisfied by the result of
this 4 hours project.
Next up I think I'll develop a gopher tool to display soccer leagues
tables, would that interest some of you?
Until then, happy gophing!
